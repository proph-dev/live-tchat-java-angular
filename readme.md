# Simple PoC for a chat application

This project consists in creating a simple web application enabling two users to communicate in a common chat via different sessions. This project is only a PoC, so the scope is limited.

The backend was built using Java and Springboot, with web sockets for communication within the chat.

The frontend is based on the Angular framework.
